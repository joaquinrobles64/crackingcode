## Going through Gayle Laakmann McDowell's famous Cracking the Coding Interview book and doing problems following this guide: https://www.sdeskills.com/ctci
The software industry absolutely adores giving whiteboard problems above all else, so I have no choice but to adhere to and conquer this culture.

- I time myself for 30 minutes to solve a question.

- If I have a good concept for the problem I'll just keep going until I finish, and then I'll check out a solution; whether it be from the book or just somewhere online.

- Else if I have some solution that really sucks or I'm completely lost then I'll look for guidance/advice first and try again with that, and *then* finally I'll look at the solution.

Let's hope this practice will help me land a job LOL
